# Furqan Software Etiquette

At Furqan Software, we understand the importance of having a team handbook. As a young, growing company, we are always learning new things, and adapting ourselves to those experiences. Based on what we learn and how we adapt, we document our practices in our internal Etiquette wiki.

This repository serves as a window into a part of our internal Etiquette wiki. Whether you are thinking of joining our team, or hiring our team for our expertise, this handbook serves as an outline of our practices, workflows, and more.

As time goes on, we will be making more and more of our internal handbook public so that others may benefit from what we have learnt in our journey so far.
