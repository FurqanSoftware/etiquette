# Daily Check-ins

We will begin each day by answering a few questions:

```
Did you work on what you wanted to yesterday? If not, what happened?
What will you work on today?
What obstacles or issues are impeding your progress?
```

The questions will appear in the Check-ins channel at 8 am every morning. If you are working that day, please make sure you answer them by 12 noon. Even if you plan to start working later in the day, allocate a few minutes to plan your day in the morning and answer those questions accordingly.
