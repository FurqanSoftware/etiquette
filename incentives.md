# Incentives

## Discretionary Bonuses

Every now and then, the company may reward you when you really shine by going above and beyond your regular responsibilities and tasks. The bonus will be paid to you as a part of your next salary.

Your growth in performance can also lead to an increase in your salary. If you think you are meeting the requirements for another title, or think your growth should be reflected in your compensation please feel free to discuss with your manager.

## Festive Bonuses

As a way for the company to thank you, we have festive bonuses for Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. The bonus will be equal to your basic salary.

The bonus will be paid a week before the holiday begins.
