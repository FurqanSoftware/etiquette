# Working Remotely

## Work From Anywhere With Good Internet

Working from anywhere means more time with loved ones, no commute, and controlling everything about your workspace.

The one requirement is having a strong internet connection.

## Be Explicit

Working remote means it may take time before a person reads your message and responds, so make sure you are clear.

Communicate relevant information in the first message:

- Avoid “Are you free to talk?” and “Can we talk about something at 3pm?”, instead use “Can we speak about ulimit issue Customer X is having?”

Write unambiguously:

- Avoid “I think the answer is Yes”, instead use “Yes”, “No”, or “I think the answer is Yes, I’ll confirm with Steve and let you know.”

Likewise, we emphasize written communication. Reading is faster than listening and it reaches more people, which means more happens in less time.

## Follow Through

When working on problems, make sure to be clear about next steps, and either follow through or create a ticket to track the work.

## Be the Change You Want to See

When something’s not clearly documented, take the initiative to figure out what’s going on and update the documentation for the people who come after you.
