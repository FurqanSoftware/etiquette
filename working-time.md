# Working Time

Working Time defines the days and hours that you are expected to actively contribute for the purposes of the company and to accomplish any work assigned to you. The company operates from Sunday through Thursday between the local hours 8am and 6pm, and the working time may only be from within this period. 

## Bandwidth Period

A bandwidth period is a period within which you are required to complete the effective working hours you are expected to work. In our case, it is the operating hours of the company, i.e. from 8am to 6pm.

## Core Period

A core period is a period of the day during which you are required to be at work. In our case, it is from 11am to 3pm. You are free to choose your own workday start and end times as long as you are available for work during this period.
